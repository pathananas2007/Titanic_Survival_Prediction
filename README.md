# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

Predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and family relations.

**Key Objectives:**

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (FamilySize, IsAlone, Title, AgeGroup, FareCategory, Deck)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC
- Generate submission file for Kaggle

🔍 Key Features & Insights
FamilySize: Combined SibSp + Parch + 1

IsAlone: Whether the passenger traveled alone

Title: Extracted from Name (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Other)

AgeGroup & FareCategory: Categorized for model performance

Deck: Derived from Cabin

Results from Random Forest:

Validation Accuracy: ~[insert value]

ROC-AUC Score: ~[insert value]

Insights:

Female passengers had higher survival rates

Passengers in higher classes had better survival chances

Age and family size influenced survival outcomes
